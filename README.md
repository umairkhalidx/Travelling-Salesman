# Travelling-Salesman

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well known optimization problem in the field of computer science. It is a well-known NP-hard problem, which means that as the number of cities (points) increases, the complexity grows exponentially. The objective of the TSP is to find the shortest possible route that allows a traveling salesman to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting city.

The problem can be described as follows:
    Given a set of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the task is to find a tour that visits all cities exactly once and has the minimum total distance.
    The tour must form a closed loop, meaning the salesman returns to the city from which he started.
    The salesman is not required to visit all cities in a specific order; he just needs to find the optimal sequence that minimizes the total distance traveled.

The Travelling Salesman is yet somewhat similar to a Hamiltonian Circuit. There are multiple ways to solve this problem which includes
